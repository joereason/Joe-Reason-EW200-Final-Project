# Joe-Reason-EW200-Final-Project
The objective of the game is to collect as much wood as possible without dying.
To collect objects, collide with them.
You are competing with the other player. You want to collect more wood than them while avoiding the deer.
Deer will run across the screen and try to hit you. If you are hit, you lose a life. Jump over the deer to not get hit.
You have 3 lives. Food will spawn in. Collect it to get a life back. You cannot get more than the 3 lives you started with.
When one player dies, it's game over.
Controls:
  Player 1: Up (jump), Left (move left), Right (move right)
  Player 2: W (jump), A (move left), D (move right)
