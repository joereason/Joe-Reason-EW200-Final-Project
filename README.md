# Joe-Reason-EW200-Final-Project
The objective of the game is to collect as much wood as possible without dying.
\nTo collect objects, collide with them.
\nYou are competing with the other player. You want to collect more wood than them while avoiding the deer.
\nDeer will run across the screen and try to hit you. If you are hit, you lose a life. Jump over the deer to not get hit.
\nYou have 3 lives. Food will spawn in. Collect it to get a life back. You cannot get more than the 3 lives you started with.
\nWhen one player dies, it's game over.

\nControls:
